            <p style="margin-left:10px;">We&apos;re amping up chicken breasts with a glaze of smoky ancho chile paste and fresh orange juice in this recipe. On the side, roasted carrots and lightly creamy, golden raisin-studded rice perfectly accent the sweetness of the glaze.</p>

Once boiling, cover and reduce the heat to low. Cook 12 to 14 minutes, or until the water has been absorbed and the rice is tender. Turn off the heat and fluff with a fork. Cover to keep warm.</p>

        <p>While the rice cooks, wash and dry the fresh produce. Peel the carrots; quarter lengthwise, then halve crosswise. Peel and roughly chop the garlic. Remove and discard the stems of the kale; finely chop the leaves. Using a peeler, remove the lime rind, avoiding the white pith; mince to get 2 teaspoons of zest (or use a zester). Halve the lime crosswise. Halve the orange; squeeze the juice into a bowl, straining out any seeds. Whisk in the chile paste and 2 tablespoons of water until smooth.</p>
